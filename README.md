Hello! This is my first project on GitHub.

## Exercise: Modify Your README

### Step 1: Edit the File
Click on the README.md file in the left column. It will open in the center.
Write something, for example: Hello! This is my first project on GitHub.
(You will see a white dot on the file tab, which means it is not saved).

### Step 2: Save Changes (Commit)
Now we need to save the work on GitHub.
Click on the third icon in the left sidebar (the one that looks like a "branch", it is the "Source Control").
At the top, you will see a space for a "Message". Write a brief description of what you did (e.g., Modified the README).
Click the blue "Commit & Push" button (or "Sync Changes"). It will ask for confirmation, say yes.
Done! If you now close Codespaces and return to your repository page on GitHub (e.g., github.com/YOUR-NAME/primo-project), you will see the text you wrote!

## How to Shut Down and Reopen
**Shut Down:** Close the browser tab.
**Reopen:** Go to github.com/codespaces and click on your codespace.

## How to Launch the HTML File?

To view html pages in codespace we need to activate a small server.

Fortunately, it is possible to install the live server extension. Go to the Extensions square.

Install Live Server.

Return to the file panel and right-click on the file and choose the 'Open with Live Server' option.

At this point press Make Public (to make port 5500 where live server runs public).

**Note:** Pressing ports in the bottom right opens the open ports menu.

Clicking the world icon opens the desired port in a browser.
